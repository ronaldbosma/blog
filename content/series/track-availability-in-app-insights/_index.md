title: "Track Availability in App Insights"
---

This series explores different scenarios for tracking availability in Application Insights. We cover using standard tests, .NET Azure Functions and Logic Apps workflows to monitor the availability of your backend systems.

Each post includes practical examples that you can deploy and test yourself. All samples are available in a companion repository with complete Bicep templates and Azure Developer CLI (azd) configuration, making it easy to deploy the necessary Azure resources yourself.
