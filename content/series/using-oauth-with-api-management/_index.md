title: "Using OAuth with API Management"
---

This series explores different scenarios for implementing OAuth with Azure API Management. We cover both protecting APIs with OAuth and calling OAuth-protected resources from various Azure services and CI/CD pipelines. 

Each post includes practical examples that you can deploy and test yourself. All samples are available in a companion repository with complete Bicep templates and Azure Developer CLI (azd) configuration, making it easy to deploy the necessary Azure resources yourself.

Allthough all samples use APIs on Azure API Management, most of the concepts and configurations can also be applied to OAuth-protected APIs in general.
